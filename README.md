[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

My collection of the best rhythm game resources I can find, hopefully making discovery and play easier for everyone who reads. (Mainly focused on play and not for mapping/charting)

# Taiko no Tatsujin
>Some resources taken from [The Taiko no Tatsujin Simulator Guide](https://guide.tjadataba.se/)

### Official Ways To Play
> You can buy the game on Nintendo Switch and PS4

- [Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival!](https://www.nintendo.com.au/games/nintendo-switch/taiko-no-tatsujin-rhythm-festival)
- [Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum Session!](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/taiko-no-tatsujin-drum-session/)

### Simulators
>You may need to change you system locale to a japanese one for some of these simulators, you can do that with [Locale Emulator](https://xupefei.github.io/Locale-Emulator/)

>You also might need to install the Taiko no Tatsujin Fonts here: [Font 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Au8BzkPLCIunt-GypA4qvkUtpwGnKisp/view), [Font 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OKbd2f4lGFwLkkp3wiENsybwc6VvLc6r/view), [Font 3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Au8BzkPLCIunt-GypA4qvkUtpwGnKisp/view).

- [OpenTaiko](https://github.com/0auBSQ/OpenTaiko/releases/): OpenTaiko is probably the most accessible simulator, I started with this one before trying to find others closer to the official arcade version
- [TJAPlayer3](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qit5aYGK1TBh6qMOKBkKeqqXnO3Ckfig): The base of most modern simulators
- [TJAPlayer3GL](https://discord.gg/t7dwc2Nm3a): TJAPlayer3 for those with weak graphics cards
- [TJAPlayer3-f](https://github.com/Mr-Ojii/TJAPlayer3-f/releases): Some of the code of the original TJAPlayer3 is pretty bad, this aims to fix it

### Official Songs/Custom Songs

- [ESE (Every Song Ever)](https://ese.tjadataba.se/ESE/ESE): Every official Taiko song released in .tja format
- [TJADB](https://tjadataba.se/): Custom songs by the community

# DDR/Stepmania
> One of my favourite rhythm games and probably one of my favourite *games* ever

### Clients

- [StepMania](https://www.stepmania.com/): The Primary Engine for Simfiles
> [Tutorial](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki)
- [Etterna](https://etternaonline.com/): My main program for Simfiles, based on the StepMania Engine but more focused on accomodating more expert and leaderboard oriented play
> [Tutorial](https://youtu.be/WrUTderimUo)
- [Project Outfox](https://projectoutfox.com/): Technically more than 4k but still based on the StepMania engine, Features 18 different modes simulating different dance, instrument, and key-based rhythm games. (also includes .osz (osu mania map) support)
> [Tutorial](https://outfox.wiki/)

### Simfiles
> Most Simfiles are in packs for ease of access, you might have to look elsewhere to get song files individually

- [Etterna Packs](https://etternaonline.com/packs)
- [StepMania Packs](https://www.stepmania.com/forums/song-packs/)
- [Arcade Simfiles](https://zenius-i-vanisher.com/v5.2/simfiles.php?category=simfiles): These are files pretty much ripped directly from the arcade versions of DDR, you'll have to download them individually if you want them all though

### Arcade Emulation
> You can emulate Arcade hardware using MAME

- [MAME](https://www.mamedev.org/release.html): The latest release of MAME
- [MAME ROM's, CHD's and BIOS'](https://r-roms.github.io/megathread/retro/#arcade): You should be able to find most games by using CTRL+F and searching for "ddr", not all games work but the ones that do are great

# Bemani / BMS
> Most of this information is taken from the [BMS Community Discord Server](https://discord.gg/HMZ7h8UVC5)

### Clients

- [Lunatic Rave 2 HD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GB1I6LSWnOeQbdpqj4doue7wLT15h-vX/view): The original is in a 4:3 aspect ratio so this aims to improve on it
> [Guide](https://news.keysounds.net/lr2guide) (you should read it)

- [Beatojara](https://mocha-repository.info/download.php): I don't remember much about this but I know it's also pretty servicable
> [Guide](https://github.com/wcko87/beatoraja-english-guide/wiki)

- [Qwilight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1910130/Qwilight/): Another client I don't remember much but it's on Steam for easy access I guess
- [QMS](https://misoshiru-cpp.jimdo.com/download/): Yeah I got no idea bout this one

### Song Packs
> Similiar to DDR/Stepmania, Songs are downloaded in packs, These files can be pretty big so make sure you have some space on your hard drive
